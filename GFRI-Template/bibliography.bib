abstract = {In this paper we will explore the consequences of the Mohr-Coulomb criterion on the constitutive equation proposed by Rajagopal and Massoudi [1]. This contunuum model which is based on the earlier works of Cowin [2] has also the ability to predict the dilatancy effect which is related to the normal stress effects. At the same time, if a proper representation is given to some of the material parameters, this model would also comply with the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. We also present, as a special case, an exact solution for the case of simple shear flows.},

@article{Gutierrez2009,
abstract = {Non-coaxiality occurs when the directions of the principal plastic strain increments and the principal stresses deviate. Extensive experimental data have now conclusively shown that plastic flow in granular soils is non-coaxial particularly during loadings involving rotation of the principal stress directions. One way to integrate the effects of non-coaxiality is by modifying the expressions for energy dissipation and stress-dilatancy used in modeling plastic deformation of granular soils. In this regard, the paper's main objective is to derive a non-coaxial version of Rowe's stress-dilatancy relation, thereby making it more general and applicable to loadings involving principal stress rotation. The paper also applies Rowe's non-coaxial stress-dilatancy equation in the determination of the effects of principal stress rotation in granular soils during simple shear loading conditions. Previous experimental data from simple shear tests on sand are used to validate the proposed non-coaxial version of Rowe's stress-dilatancy relation.},

abstract = { Extensive data of the strength and dilatancy of 17 sands in axisymmetric or plane strain at different densities and confining pressures are collated. The critical state angle of shearing resistance of soil which is shearing at constant volume is principally a function of mineralogy and can readily be determined experimentally within a margin of about 1°, being roughly 33° for quartz and 40° for feldspar. The extra angle of shearing of ‘dense' soil is correlated to its rate of dilation and thence to its relative density and mean effective stress, combined in a new relative dilatancy index. The data of {\o}′max – {\o}′crit in triaxial or plane strain are separately fitted within a typical margin of about 2°, though the streneth of certain sands is underpredicted in the 1000–10000 kN/m2 range owing to the continued dilation of their crush-resistant grains. The practical consequences of these new correlations are assessed, with regard to both laboratory and field testing procedures. L'auteur analyse de nombreuses donn{\'{e}}es concernant la r{\'{e}}sistance et la dilatance de 17 sables sous d{\'{e}}formation plane ou axisym{\'{e}}trique pour diff{\'{e}}rentes densit{\'{e}}s et pressions d'{\'{e}}treinte. L'angle de r{\'{e}}sistance au cisaillement dans l'{\'{e}}tat critique d'un sol soumis au cisaillement {\`{a}} volume constant est principalement une fonction de la min{\'{e}}ralogie et peut se d{\'{e}}terminer facilement {\`{a}} 1° pr{\`{e}}s, comme ayant une valeur d'environ 33° pour le quartz et 40° pour le feldspath.

abstract = { Techniques of modern thermomechanics are used to analyse the stress–dilatancy relation for shear deformations of frictional, granular materials. Central to this approach is the recognition that in general, deformations of granular materials can involve stored plastic work. It is recognised that in shear deformations, where the shape of the grains induces the dilatancy, the confining pressure is a constraint and dissipates no energy. Nevertheless it is shown that, in such a shear deformation, the total plastic work rate is equal to the rate of energy dissipation, and that this is given by Thurairajah's classical observations. It is further shown that anisotropy is necessarily induced, and that the stress–dilatancy relation is given by Taylor's well-known formula. It is also demonstrated that the extant procedure for deducing yield conditions and flow rules from specified dissipation functions is invalid. },
